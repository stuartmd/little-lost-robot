- Published and frustrated by the core dump on exit... :D
- Grab/Relase behaviour was by design (unique commands to be queued), but will add a "toggle grabber" command
- Replaced Grab/Release with a Toggle Grabber option
- Need to improve workflow - looks like I forgot to run make install to properly test textures
